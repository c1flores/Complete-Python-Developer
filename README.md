## How to Start
1. Read Through Each Section: Each section in this repository corresponds to a module in the course. Start from the beginning and progress through each section methodically.

2. Perform Code-Along Exercises: For each section, there are code-along exercises. These are practical tasks where you can apply what you've learned. It's crucial to actually code along rather than just reading, as this will enhance your understanding and skills.

<br />

## Course Structure
1. Section-by-Section Learning: Each section is designed to build upon the previous one. Start from the 'Introduction' and work your way through to the 'Bonus Sections'. Each section contains a mix of theoretical concepts and practical applications.

2. Hands-On Coding Exercises: At the end of most sections, you'll find coding exercises. These are practical tasks where you'll apply the concepts you've just learned. It's important to actually write the code yourself to get the full benefit of the course.

3. Project-Based Learning: The course includes several projects, such as building web applications with Flask and engaging in data science and machine learning tasks. These projects are your opportunity to put everything you've learned into practice and build something tangible.
